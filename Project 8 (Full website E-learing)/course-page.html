                A playground, playpark, or play area is a place designed to provide
                an environment for children that facilitates play, typically
                outdoors. While a playground is usually designed for children, some
                are designed for other age groups, or people with disabilities. A
                playground might exclude children below a certain age.

            <p>
                College dining halls are usually large, cafeteria-style establishments that feed thousands of students quickly three times a day. That is to say, they're not typically seen as producing restaurant-caliber food.

    <p>Consider running a monochromatic filter over some of your photographs just as Rook have done here for their <br>team member portraits. This will give you a tighter hold on the colors used in your About Us page and help to keep your palette small and strong.</p>
